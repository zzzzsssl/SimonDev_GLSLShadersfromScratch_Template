CHANGELOG:

July 25, 2022:
 * Re-uploaded Section 8 - Transformations to fix an audio issue.

July 20, 2022:
 * There was confusion around naming for the project files. The videos reference Shaders_X but they were uploaded using the naming scheme Section_X. These have all been changed back to the original "Shaders_X" naming convention. Sorry for the confusion.
 * Added this README.txt file.
